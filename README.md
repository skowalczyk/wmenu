wmenu - dynamic menu
====================
wmenu is a generic menu for windows, inspired and (mostly) compatible with dmenu.

Getting started
------------
You can download pre-built x86 binaries from the release section or you can build it yourself.

In order to build wmenu you need SFML headers and dlls that can easily be obatined through [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).

VS2017+ is environment of choice and solution is in this repo, but it is not a requirement as project can be compiled on any C++17 compiler under any environment SFML targets
